The (Danish) National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3) has created a four part advent [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) challenge this year. In a CTF you compete against the clock ‚è± to be the first to solve a series of challenges/riddles that involve different aspects of programming/forensics/&lt;stuff&gt; tasks.

This is a writeup explaining how I solved the second challenge in this years advent CTF & managed to snatch the first place in this round.

The challenge started with a file I had to download "2.pcapng", the fileformat "pcap" is usually a packetcapture, opening the file in Wireshark I could see that it was a USB packet capture. Looking at the device info revealed that it was input from a keyboard. To the search engine! searching for "pcapng usb capture keyboard" I found a writeup from another CTF, with a [script](https://github.com/WCSC/writeups/tree/master/icectf-2016/intercepted_1). Using this script (with some small modifications: changing from dvorak to qwerty) i got this:

```console
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# tshark -r 2.pcapng -T fields -e usb.capdata -Y usb.capdata 2>/dev/null | python usb_to_ascii.py 
Jeeg haarr liigge tteessteet miin toastteermallwwarre og iinnggeenn antiviiruus dettecteerrede dden! Fedt man. Den haar sha/2556 42c3d3ba5c099106fc21ab53908495d5ef2ff9fcaa890b1c7ef4386bc0893f2f???f2f
```

okay, so this contains a sha256 hash, and it mentions something about antivirus scanners not detecting the file‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ maybe I should search virustotal for the hash? [SUCCESS!](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/42c3d3ba5c099106fc21ab53908495d5ef2ff9fcaa890b1c7ef4386bc0893f2f/community)

In the comments someone mentions that the "virus" is trying to connect to 45.63.119.180 on port 9999 and sending the text "HELLO". Maybe we should just try to do the same then?

```console
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# netcat -q2 45.63.119.180 9999 echo <<< "HELLO"
nc3ctffqqn5ozfjy.onion/2092c7a391323c18413e33f9840c47e6
```

okay so we get a new address! wonder what's there‚Ä¶ aaaand it's another download link to a file named "g"? so what is this "g" file?

```console
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# file g
g: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=67f9fe06fd8f37032e969f3b49583140629810c4, not stripped
```

it's a binary/executable, let's try to run it! *(This is pretty bad practice running unknown code‚Ä¶ and as root to boot(pun intended) but whatever #YOLO)*

```console
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# chmod +x g
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# ./g
23/09/90 kl. 01:12:12 UTC er det helt rigtige unix-tidspunkt til at skabe en URL
nc3ctffqqn5ozfjy.onion/983572806
```

okay so apparently this program needs to be run at a specific time in the past, let's try it out.

```console
root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/nc3-2# date -s "09/23/90 01:12:12 UTC" && ./g
Sun Sep 23 03:12:12 CEST 1990
23/09/90 kl. 01:12:12 UTC er det helt rigtige unix-tidspunkt til at skabe en URL
nc3ctffqqn5ozfjy.onion/1228468024
```

and there you have it! the flag was behind the last address üòä

**‚è± Total time: 19 minutes and 31 seconds**

Looking forward to next sunday üéÖ

I could have shaved a couple of seconds off the time, the first time I tried to submit a " " whitespace char snuck into the flag, so I had to write my "name" again, this resulted in me typing the wrong twitter handle and pressing submit ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
