The (Danish) National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3) has created a four part advent [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) challenge this year. In a CTF you compete against the clock ‚è± to be the first to solve a series of challenges/riddles that involve different aspects of programming/forensics tasks.

This is a writeup explaining how I solved the third challenge in this years advent CTF, This time I only managed to get the 13th best time, but it was great fun and I learned a lot of new stuff!

This time we were presented with the following text and two links, the first link was to a binary file "three.dd", the second link was to a manual explaining the architecture of the filesystem.

>Den 7. august 2017 vandt professor Kiwistone prisen "Fejl00", der hvert √•r gives til udvikleren af √•rets mest h√•bl√∏st forfejlede stykke software. Professoren vandt prisen for filsystem "FragFS". Filsystemet udm√¶rker sig negativt ved et v√¶ld af manglende funktioner og voldsomt fragmenteret data. Dette forhindrede dog ikke gerningsmanden B. Tarp i at bruge det til at gemme koden til en krypteret harddisk. Find koden(flaget), der er gemt i filsystemet, ved at bruge manualen udf√¶rdiget af Kiwistone.

(It's basically the story of "professor Kiwistone" who won the award for the year's most hopelessly flawed piece of software. He wrote the filesystem "FragFS", a file system that lacked even the most basic stuff and was incredibly fragmented. But this didn't prevent the perpetrator "B. Tarp" form hiding the code for an encrypted drive in a FragFS filesystem. Our job is to find the code (the flag) hidden in the filesystem by using the manual Kiwistone wrote.)

The manual is reproduced here in full:

So from this we can extract the following variables, that are going to be useful:
`sectorSize = 4096` and `dataStart = sectorSize * 20` (I actually misunderstood the whole sector/data part the first time round, but we'll get to that later)

This was the first time that I've been working with filesystems, so I needed to read up a bit before I could get anywhere with this challenge. I found a [pretty good primer on the subject](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/forensics/) that got me startet on the right path.

The first thing that I needed was to figure out how the different tables in the filesystem were seperated. For whis I used the command `xxd three.dd | less` this gave me the file contents in three columns

|Line number|Hex|ASCII|
|:----------|:--|:----|
|00002cb0:|2032 3039 3000 ff36 3833 3036 3637 3132| 2090..683066712|
|00002cc0:|3037 3764 3438 3139 3535 6632 6461 3539|077d481955f2da59|

We know that the two filetables are in the sectors 0 through 19, everything from sector 20 and on is the filedata.

![sector overview no-border full-width](/assets/img/posts/fragfs-sectors.svg)

But we need to figure out where the first table `[FileID and Filepath/Filename]` stops and the second table `[FileID and Offsets]` starts. We start by inspecting the data from sector `0` (but we ignore the first 512 bytes, as they're just the filesystem version info).

![sector overview no-border w100](/assets/img/posts/fragfs-hash-and-path.svg)

We know that the table starts with an MD5 hash of the filepath + filename, MD5 hashes are always 32 charaters in length. Looking at the table above we can see that immediately after the first 32 chars, there is a <span class="highlight-red">`0x00`</span> value to the right of that value we can see the filepath + filename, let's call it the "column" seperator. Next we're hitting a <span class="highlight-red">`0x00`</span> again but this time it's followed by 2 <span class="highlight-green">`0xFF`</span> values. Combied they give us <span class="highlight-green">`0x00 0xFF 0xFF`</span> this is a new set of seperators that mark the "rows" in the table. If we try to visualize it we get something that looks like this:

|MD5|Filename + Filepath|
|:--|:------------------|

|683066712077d481955f2da59222e9d6|filsystem/gits/gef/docs/commands/memory.md|

Great we've got the first table down! One more to go! So we keep scrolling through the the xxd output until we hit something that looks fresh :tomato:

![sector overview no-border w100](/assets/img/posts/fragfs-table-seperator.svg)

Line 6832 is where it's at! The output suddenly changes and everything we thought we knew crumbles‚Ä¶ okay so maaaaybe it's not that bad after all 'cause now we've found the second table! and we're in luck, there's a new seperator! <span class="highlight-blue">`0x00 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0xFF 0x00`</span> So now we know where the first table starts and stops! and also the second table. The first starts at offset `512` and ends when we encouter a <span class="highlight-blue">`0x00 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0xFF 0x00`</span>. the second table then start immediately after that and ends at sector `20` or offset `81920`. Now let's take a closer and see if we can figure out how the second table `[FileID and Offsets]` should be read:

![sector overview no-border w100](/assets/img/posts/fragfs-hash-and-offsets.svg)

This table is supposed to consist of the FileID (the MD5 for the first table) and a list of offsets specifying where the different parts of the file are stored. Here we find a new seperator <span class="highlight-teal">`0x00 0xFF`</span> this is the "row" seperator for the second table. In the second table <span class="highlight-red">`0x00`</span> is used as the "column" seperator again. But the offsets are also seperated by a hex value `0x20` or simply a " " whitespace char. If we visualize the second table we get:

|MD5|offsets|
|:--|:------|
|31f84df100b0c302c05f39c6e42deeb2|1002 1737 1560 1405 1272 1098 981 1597 1698 1943 1071 1386 590 1199 351 1176 1963 2104 1473 1557 1180 1659 1247 332 888 2093 1160 1771 1673 379 660 1697 804 1291 1023 2069 655 2131 437 1317 1076 1852 222 2166 1788 1871 847 329 1559 2193 328 2061 666 1024 1439 2075 489 766 1114 1381 2126 1613 1844 1621 986 1107 806 1564 884 1912 2182 980 1980 1638 1812 393 1712 1555 2059 706 733 875 1964 1685 1875 1786 1210 520 1989 1543 1683 1276 1064 299 1352 1566 1263 1243 1073 2090|

Now we've got everything we need to "carve" :knife: the files out the "three.dd" file. So I wrote a python script that would generate the files on my own harddrive, by reading the two tables and then assembling the files from the offsets. The script ran and everything was peachy :peach:‚Ä¶ 

That is until I tried to open one of the files and it was total garbage üóë. The pdf file on "stack smashing"? it was filled with random python code intermingled with binary data. Not good‚Ä¶ I knew that `autosolver` was also doing the challenge so I hit him up on `<messenger app>`, and it turns out that I (as I mentioned earlier) had misunderstood the part about the sector offsets. I thought that sector `0` would be placed at offset `81920`, when infact sector `0` was at offset `0` üò±.

Fixing that mistake, and running the script again gave me all the files‚Ä¶ with the proper content this time :+1: quickly trawling though the files I found the flag superimposed in an image file.

**‚è± Total time: 2 hours 23 minutes and 47 seconds**

Almost forgot the script (‚ö†Ô∏è ugly code!):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ern-st/05bded95cec7a2eede428379e86c1a7b.js"></script>

**TL;DR: It was a super fun challenge, I made some stupid mistakes but I learned a lot. It was also my first time using Pythons bytearrays‚Ä¶ they're pretty pretty smart!**
